### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lance. Nice to meet you. Recently I took great interest in coding and just started learning web development through boot camps and other youtube tutorials.
I aspire to be a fullstack web developer. 
I usually like to explore more tools and new skills to keep me versatile and efficient as a programmer.
I have learned to appreciate readable, elegant code over my time as a baby developer.
I like to code things from scratch, also read other's code and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.
I value simple content structure, clean code patterns,object oriented procedures and thoughtful interactions.
And I find recursive solutions beautiful. 

Feel free to follow me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ElijahLanceCatli), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/xeuhellscythe/?hl=en), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijah-lance-catli-b08725172/) if you want to know more about my open source adventures! âœ¨
